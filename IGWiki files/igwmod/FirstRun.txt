[prefix{l}]Version 2.6.1: Still Stopped. Little Hotfix[prefix{}]

Neglected to include updated TechNodefirmacraft mod. Fixes glaring issue.

[prefix{l}]Version 2.6: Stop. Hammer Time.[prefix{}]

This week we've made a few changes that we feel really add to the playability of the pack. First we've added a new function to the TFC hammer. It is now the builders best friend. It will break smooth stone, bricks and even mod blocks quite quickly compared to the pick. It is made for building and using it on blocks touching raw stone, dirt and other natural blocks will risk ruining your tool.

We've improved WAILA tooltips in the pack. We've changed the TFC "useless" field to be much more informative. We've also added the base metal tip to the nuggets. Even we forget what Scapolite is.

It seems that one of the mod updates has caused our bears to go cross eyed. It seems they won't be able to see you from quite so far away. You definitely want to still keep your distance.

There has been a lot of changes in HQM as far as quest creation. This has allowed us to better edit and collaborate on quests. There has been a large rewrite of quests and a few extras added in. This should help speed the progress in introducing more content to the tutorial quest and offer more quest options.

There has been a few recipe fixes and one addition. It is now possible to craft a boat pre-metal. Just craft 3 of any log and a new stone axe. Credit to rjdunlap of Extrokoldgames for the inspiration.

We've added 2 new server mods. The first is the Discord talk/text minecraft plugin mod. This will allow servers to share their Discord information with players to help with communication. We've tested it out and have been quite pleased with its quality. MCDiscord must be installed on client and server. We also added in World Border Forge. This mod will allow servers to set borders and pre-generate chunks offline. Pre-generation of terrain greatly improves server performance. Both these mods are optional.

Other changes are that the Transport Crate now only has 5 uses. Additions to the Transport Crate black list. Changed the recommended Mini-map to Journeymap.
