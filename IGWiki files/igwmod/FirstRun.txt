[prefix{l}]Version 2.9: Get your Torches and Pitchforks.[prefix{}]

First is updates for Immersive Engineering, Forestry and Railcraft. These fix a bunch of issues and add in some fun toys. Hopefully some better stability for these mods with the update. Note the Do Not use TFC tools in the IE Assembler as they will be consumed in first craft.

So those torches and pitchforks, point them at Bunsan as this weeks update is a major rebalancing of the energy systems in the pack. We've got through and compared and tweaked the balance of the various power systems to the best of our ability. We've tried to normalize to material costs and maintain consistency across the various mods.

There will be greater stability in the pack with the various bug fixes and updates. We understand that all the changes will not all be popular, but we feel they are important changes to make.
