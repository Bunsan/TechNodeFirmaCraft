[prefix{l}]Version 3.7: This Thing isn't a Thing so don't expect more Things from this Thing.

So I had an itch to play this old pack a bit ago and needed to rebuild my instance to add in a few fixes. Then I've had a few reports of little issues. So I thought I might as well make the fixes and push this stuff out as an update. Contains a few recipe fixes, performance fixes and even some new content. Back up your worlds before updating as it has been a while so there may be some issues.
