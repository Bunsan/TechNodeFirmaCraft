[prefix{l}]2.4 - Electric Cooler Acid Test[prefix{}]

You've reached the heights of technology; you jetpack about the world with nary a care; everything is automated. So why are you still storing your food in a dusty jar in some dark hole? Introducing the Electric Refrigerated Chest! Formerly known as the Mekanism Electric Chest this device, when provided with a constant stream of power, will keep your food items icy cold for long term preservation. Can also act as the ultimate place to cool off those hot metal items.  Of course, this functionality doesn't come cheap. The recipe is expensive, as-is the upkeep.

We've also fixed a number of other containers (BetterStorage) so that heat and food decay is also accounted for. No more cheaty chests for you!
