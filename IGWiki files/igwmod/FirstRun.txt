[prefix{l}]Version 2.10.2 - Alloy Furnace Duping? Is this 1.2.5?[prefix{}]

Little hotfix to disable the BP Alloy Furnace Recycling recipes. When they said they were recreating some of the missing features of past mods, didn't realize they include making iron from nothing. Also fixed a couple of Mek recipes referencing the wrong items.

[prefix{l}]Version 2.10.1 - Don't eat Saws[prefix{}]

There was an error in the Better Storage Recipes that caused saws to be consumed. Apologies for any lost saws.

Mods Added:
- Item Physics Lite as an optional mod

prefix{l}]Version 2.10 - I Meant Chicken Nuggets[prefix{}]

Lots of rough edges smoothed with this update. Winter is winterier, rain is rainier, ingots are more nuggatable, oil is more drilliable. Many of those words I just made up. The only major addition is BluePower which will be replacing RedLogic in the future.

Changes:
- TFC has nuggets. All metals now come in nugget form. Nuggets can be created with an ingot and a chisel.
- BetterStorage has chest and locker recipes for all metal nuggets.
- BluePower has been added to provide redstone logic and wiring. This will be replacing RedLogic due to its lack of support for FMP microblocks. Replace your wiring and circuitry! RedLogic will be removed in a month or so. A recycling recipe for RedLogic lighting has been provided to return the glowstone/scapolite blocks.
- Snow will now accumulate on the ground in winter with the Local Weather mod.
-  Mekanism Solar devices will not operate during local rainstorms.
- Mekanism recipes moved out of scripts into the mod. Should fix confusion with various recipes.
- Fixes for Local Weather should increase accuracy of TFC items detecting rain and filling barrels, putting out torches, etc.
- MineTweaker scripts no longer required to be in zip format.
- Santa hired some muscle.

Added:
- PneumaticCrap - Adds a Advanced Gas Lift for deep oil extraction
- BluePower - Adds logic and wiring. Will be replacing RedLogic.

Updated:
- Immersive Engineering
- TerraFirmaCraft 
- Weather2
- Mekanism
