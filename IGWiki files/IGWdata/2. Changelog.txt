[prefix{l}]Version 2.2: Explosions, Tornados and Bees. Oh My.[prefix{}]

  First we want to say a big thank you to all of you for supporting this pack. It has been quite the week since becoming a public pack. This update brings some new content, some bug fixes and a few tweaks.

  We’ve added two optional mods. Weather2 provides localized weather and storms for your enjoyment. There are tornados, but we’ve set them so they can kill you, but not ruin your base or fling your livestock. Prattle is a chat mod that provides local chat and multiple chat channels on servers.   We have removed Zombie Awareness from the pack. This was due to it interfering with the AI of the mobs in a negative way and also having some strange interactions with Mek. We did not feel it added enough to the pack to justify keeping it.

  A key fix in this update is we are now running a custom version of BetterStorage. This is due to it having a bug where with InvTweaks it can accidentally trigger the April Fools joke and explode. Instead of being client-side only it actually explodes. The mod author has quit maintaining this mod and so we have removed the offending code ourselves (MIT Licence) and are now running a custom version. The changes can be viewed in the forked version at https://github.com/Bunsan/BetterStorage

  Forestry Bees got some love…Again. Due to my mistake the fix intended for version 2.1 was reverted. Now not only is that implemented we’ve made it so the Bees don’t care about climate. This is important because of how TFC handles biomes. There is an issue with bees in NEI so trying to search recipes or usages for them will crash your client. I will assemble a cheatsheet for bees as soon as I can and post it on the subreddit. It will be included in the IGW in future.

  Finally we’ve depreciated the HQM crutches for Bees and Trees. The bees are crafted in simple craft mimicking the HQM quest. Trees have a more elaborate mechanism. Search NEI for mulch and follow the chain. In a future update we will include some optional quest lines. We welcome community contributions of any style of quest line.

Updated Mods.
- Pneumaticcraft
- Forestry

Bug Fixes
- IE and RC Coke Ovens accept TFC coal.

- Burlap does not substitute for wool in many recipes.
- Graves no longer
- Graves no longer spawn Skeletons
- Fixed a number of exploits

Tweaks.
- Open blocks scaffolding has been balanced.
- Added Recipes for Dyes in RC, IE and Mek.


[prefix{l}]Update 2.1: Join our IPO! We're going public… Gifts for All.[prefix{}]

That’s right we are going public. 

  Thanks to all of your great interest and enthusiasm for the pack ATLauncher has accepted our request to move to a Public Pack. So what does this mean? No pesky PackCodes, this is a full release (goodbye Beta) and you get gifts. That’s right gifts for everyone. To celebrate our new status we've pushed up some plans and not only are you getting bug fixes, rebalancing and updates, we are giving you all some new mods. We are happy to include Steve’s Workshop and OpenComputers in TNCF.

  Before we get into the meat of the changelog I’d like to make a small request from all of you. We’d love some great screenshots from your world that we can add to our Start Menu slides. So send us your best and we’ll choose some to include. Please either post images on the subreddit /r/technode or tweet them to @TechNodeMC. Lastly we are moving away from HQM as a means of obtaining some forestry items. We will be working on some optional quest lines, but we would be willing to include other great player made quest lines either in pack or linking to them from our TFC forums topic or on the Subreddit.

  Now you may get or had a bit of a shock with the warning when starting up your world. All those missing forestry woods. Thankfully forestry bees were broken so nobody will have any in their worlds. Forestry has restructured all their wood and wood product code, which resulted in all those items being removed. They aren’t gone from mod, just the ID has changed. So don’t worry about that warning it will be fine. 

   The good news is that forestry bees are working and seeing the TFC flowers (replace vanilla flowers), TFC fungi and PMP fungi (replace vanilla fungus), TFC cactus and PMP cactus (it is obvious), TFC vines and ferns and a few PMP jungly things (for vanilla vines and ferns) and lastly TFC long grass (for vanilla wheat, look the TFC wheat was too hard to add in).
Forestry was always meant to be on Hard mode, however the last forestry update reset the config and set it to Easy, this has been fixed. I’ve also fixed the fermenter recipes so that TFC saplings, fruit trees and seeds give biomass. The bad news is that the forestry update broke the NEI-Integration forestry module. So for the time being you won’t be able to see a lot of information on forestry machine recipes. We will try and get this fixed as soon as possible. 

  On the Immersive Engineering front. There was a couple of updates. The big one was that the excavator will now output TFCN based ores. So piles for all and a couple of bonuses. The IE manual does update and has information. I’ve also added some recipes in for producing plant oil and ethanol. Base choices are hemp seeds for oil and reeds for ethanol. If you get into Forestry trees you will get more things you can get plant oil and ethanol from. You also have the ability to produce diesel from Forestry Ethanol and SeedOil. Details in NEI. We’ve also fixed a few things with the IE blast furnace. Depending what you input (ore, dirty dust, dust or ingot) you’ll get various products out. Most importantly it means the IE blast furnace can make Pig Iron for all your Black Steel needs.

  Note that as of 2.2 PMP will no longer be optional. The reality is that 99% of you are using it and having it in allows us to do some extra integration for Forestry bees and hopefully other mods. It is also greatly increases the steps we have to take to build every update, which leads to more errors. Besides it really does make the world look so much better.

  Other odds and ends are. Recipe for chest minecarts. Breaking drops the chest mincart item and any item in the chest. Enderchest are no longer craftable, mistakenly assumed TFC disabled but there is no blaze powder in TFC. Vanilla flowerpots recipe changed slightly. I’m sure there are other little tweaks, but that is the key stuff.

Once again Thank You so much for all your support.

[prefix{l}]Ver 2.0.2: Hotfix for TNFCMod.[prefix{}]
- An issue was occuring with our mod causing servers to simulate time when no players were online incorrectly. As this can cause serious issues with servers, we're issuing this hotfix immediately.

This also corrects some incorrect ore dictionary values registered.

[prefix{l}]Ver 2.0.1:[prefix{}]
Bug stomping is fun!

Been a great weekend with the 2.0 release. Lots of folks downloading and playing with the updated pack. A few small issues did arise. One caused a client crash so a hotfix is in order. No big changes, just some little issues brought to our attention by our awesome players.

Notes:

- Fixed issue with Oredictionary registrations of TFC ores.
- Fixed client crash with Immersive Engineering Manual.
- Added recipes for electrum dust crafting and smelting.
- Cleanup of some ore to dust recipes.
- Moved liteloader from library load to mod load. If no .litemods are selected the library will not be installed.

Mods Added:
Helpfix - Added to cleanup the /help function.

Mods Updated:
TechNodefirmacraft mod - changes to Oredictionary registrations.

[prefix{l}]Update 2.0 We're Getting the Band Back Together[prefix{}]

Mods Added:
TechNodefirmacraftMod
ImmersiveEngineering
BetterFoliage
IGW-Mod
TechNodefirmaCraftMod
ModProperties
InPureCore
FMPIntegration
ResourceLoader
zTNFCResources


Mods Changed:
TerraFirmaCraft 79.22
Merchants
AOBD
CodeChickenCore
NEIIntegration
OpenBlocks
OpenModsLib
Optifine
PlantMegaPack
Pneumaticraft
Railcraft

Mods Removed: The TechNodefirmacraft resourcepack has been removed. All name changes/custom textures moved to the new TechNodefirmacraft mod. This allows the use of other TerraFirmaCraft compatible resourcepacks. Your mileage with this may vary.

Important Configuration Changes:
- ImmersiveEngineering added and integrated into progression. Adds bauxite resource for aluminum. Impressive multiblock machines with impressive requirements.
- Pneumaticraft oil processing to replace seed processing. Oil can be pumped from reservoirs found deep underground.
- TerraFirmaCraft recommended year length changed to 360 (192 year length deprecated)
- New Custom Menu with Slideshow loader. User picture can replace images show1.png - show6.png in Resources\Slideshow
- Custom Menu provides direct links to TechNode subreddit, ATLauncher changelog and Github Issues tracker.
- PlantMegaPack - All crop and berry plants removed. Served no purpose in TechNodefirmacraft.
- FMP Integration automatically creates microblocks for all available blocks in the modpack.
- InPureCore added to cull duplicated recipes (ie: Bibliocraft bookshelf recipes for every wood type), non-craftable items and microblocks. This causes a brief delay during world load.
- IGWMod provides an In-game Wiki. Primarily for Pneumaticraft but also includes some TechNodefirmacraft information. By default, press I to access the wiki.
- MobProperties allow custom settings for mobs in-game. Used to provide ImmersiveEngineering Hemp seeds from zombies after some time in the world. Possibly other drops are available.
- Many changes to MineTweaker scripts to support ImmersiveEngineering. Change some recipes for balance.


[prefix{l}]Update 1.6a Silly Dependencies and Undocumented changes.[prefix{}]

So first something changed with bee data that meant some scripts didn't work. Those are fixed, however do not press R for recipes when hovering over a bee, this will crash your game.

Secondly Mek8 has a CofHCore dependency now. So I've put that in the pack so that Mek8 can interact with other mods power systems.

[prefix{l}]Ver 1.6:[prefix{}]
Version 1.6 Oh the Changes, Updates and Rebalancing

This update brings a lot of changes. First my actual playthrough of the pack with a friend has helped bring some more balance to the pack. Many recipes are now cheaper and more in line with others for resources and effort. In particular for Railcraft, Jabba and Ropes+ mod. Zombie Awareness has been greatly toned down so you won't have the dance parties every night at your door.

There have been a number of Mods that updated. Most importantly ModTweaker Updated its Mek Module. This has allowed me to update Mekanism to version 8. This brings a lot of new content at the highest tier including a crazy nuclear reactor. This modtweaker update also allowed me to use TFC machines for some crafts. New craft for slime balls, a number of quern recipes and hardened clay can now be made in the forge (sadly it won't display the heat tooltip).

Lots of other mods updated, such as Pneumaticcraft, Forestry, Merchants, Decorations and more.

Worldgen

Pneumaticcraft has added oil into worldgen. This will not retrogen so you will have to search out new area. The tool for locating the oil does work with TFC higher sea level. The oil will replace the seeds for producing plastics, so be warned the seeds will be vanishing soon.

I've also added in a new ore to the worldgen. Bauxite ore. This has been added with the expectation to add Immersive Engineering in a coming update.

You may possibly get a warning about some recipes overwriting when you load up your world, these are log messages and can be ignored.

Some tips. Although it may just be observer bias, our play through seemed to show that crops behaved with more variability with year length of 192 days (default is 96 and I have set it to 192 in pack). We have moved our world to 360 days (don't do this unless you know what you are doing) and would suggest if you like longer year to alter your TFCConfig.cfg to the longer year.

As always feedback is very welcome.

Cheers,
Bunsan
