TechNodeFirmaCraft
==================

Configs, scripts, resourcepack and mod information for TechNodeFirmaCraft.

This pack is published on ATLauncher as semi public pack, PackCode: TechNode. The pack has been very stable and there are no known crashing issues. Use the resource pack for some item renaming and textures for added items.

Know Issues.
- Piping into chests ignores item restriction based on size.
- No vanilla trees for tree breeding (available from HQM)
- No Nether or End so no Nether or End worldgen bee hives, the bees can be crafted, check NEI. Some are available via HQM as well.
- Some flowers for bees (logged issue with Forestry about adding different flower types in flowers config.) These flowers are available as a craft, be aware vanilla cactus must be planted in a vanilla flowerpot.
- All TFC biomes are Normal/Normal or Normal/Cold (high altitudes). You can craft bees to give them temperature and humidity tolerance to compensate.
- Other dimensions are a no go (Nether is map destroying and the End does not exist)
- 

To Do's (this is an ongoing process that will never end I think)
- Lots more tweaks
- Ore Gen is working, may need to tweak for balance
- Pursuit of balance
- Always exploring new mods


Please log any issues, technical or incompatibilities that you find.

How to build your instance.

The pack is now available on ATLauncher. PackCode TechNode.

- NEI and its dependencies/plugins aren't technically required, but I've made very extensive recipe additions and changes and they aren't documented anywhere yet. For mini-map I've been using the MapWriter built into Opis, but you can choose your preferred mini-map.

I've included the Merchants mod (only useful for SMP), the Streams mod (beautiful river systems, but intensive for generating new chunks) and many more other optional mods. Feel free to suggest more for either client and/or server.
