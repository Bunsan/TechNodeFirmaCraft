TechNodeFirmaCraft
==================

Configs, scripts, resourcepack and mod information for TechNodeFirmaCraft.

This pack is published on ATLauncher as semi public pack, PackCode: TechNode. The pack has been very stable and there are no known crashing issues in build 2.0.1

Know Issues.
- Piping into chests ignores item restriction based on size.
- No vanilla trees for tree breeding. A method for creating vanilla tree saplings is in game.
- No Nether or End so no Nether or End worldgen bee hives, the bees can be crafted, check the InGameWiki. Some are available via HQM as well.
- All TFC biomes are Normal/Normal or Normal/Cold (high altitudes). You can craft bees to give them temperature and humidity tolerance to compensate.
- Other dimensions are a no go (Nether is map destroying and the End does not exist)


Please log any issues, technical or incompatibilities that you find.
