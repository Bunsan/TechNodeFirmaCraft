TechNodeFirmaCraft
==================

Configs, scripts, resourcepack and mod information for TechNodeFirmaCraft.

This pack is a Work in Progress. It is unknown how stable this pack is at this time. Mods may come and go unannounced. Expect me to break world for a while. Use the resource pack for some item renaming and textures for added items.

Know Issues.
- Piping into chests ignores item restriction based on size.
- No vanilla trees for tree breeding (will be available from HQM)
- No Nether or End so no Nether or End based bees
- Some flowers for bees
- Other dimensions are a no go (Nether is map destroying and the End does not exist)
- 

To Do's
- Make a proper To Do list
- HQM integration to fix roadblocks more than to guide progression.
- Mob tweaking (AI and stats)
- Lots more tweaks
- A few more mods
- Ore Gen is working, need to tweak balance
- So much balancing
- Resourcepack stuff


If you are crazy enough to try please log any issues that you find.

How to build your instance.

I'm going to assume you know your way around the vanilla launcher or MultiMC. 
- You will want to run at least Forge 1272 (my dev pack is currently running in build 1292). Download from http://files.minecraftforge.net 
- In the mod list I provide links to download the mods yourself. Drop them in the mod folder, pop in the configs, script and resourcepack folders and fire it up. I've listed the mods as Required, Recommended and Optional. 
- NEI and its dependencies/plugins aren't technically required, but I've made very extensive recipe additions and changes and they aren't documented anywhere yet. For mini-map I've been using the MapWriter built into Opis, but you can choose your preferred mini-map. You may also choose to leave out Zombie Awareness and Special AI as I'm still learning them and am not sure about their balance.
