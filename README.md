TechNodeFirmaCraft
==================

Configs, scripts, resourcepack and mod information for TechNodeFirmaCraft.

This pack is a Work in Progress. It is unknown how stable this pack is at this time. Mods may come and go unannounced. Expect me to break world for a while. Use the resource pack for some item renaming and textures for added items.

Know Issues.
- Piping into chests ignores item restriction based on size.
- No vanilla trees for tree breeding (will be available from HQM)
- No Nether or End so no Nether or End based bees
- Some flowers for bees (logged issue with Forestry about adding different flower types in flowers config.)
- All TFC biomes are Normal/Normal
- Other dimensions are a no go (Nether is map destroying and the End does not exist)
- 

To Do's
- Make a proper To Do list
- HQM integration to fix roadblocks more than to guide progression.
- Lots more tweaks
- A few more mods
- Ore Gen is working, need to tweak balance
- So much balancing
- Resourcepack stuff
- Add JABBA
- Fix Bees to overcome biome and flower issues


If you are crazy enough to try please log any issues that you find.

- NEI and its dependencies/plugins aren't technically required, but I've made very extensive recipe additions and changes and they aren't documented anywhere yet. For mini-map I've been using the MapWriter built into Opis, but you can choose your preferred mini-map.
