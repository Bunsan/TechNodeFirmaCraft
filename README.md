TechNodeFirmaCraft
==================

Configs, scripts, resourcepack and mod information for TechNodeFirmaCraft.

We use a heavily modified fork of TFC and some of the mods used in the pack (labelled with TNFC). We also use a custom mod to tweak and add functionality to various mods. The scripts for the pack are designed for this pack based on these modified versions and may or may not work properly with unmodified version.

This pack is licensed under MIT open license and can be used without credit, but we will be annoyed if you claim our work as your own.

This pack is published on ATLauncher as public pack.

Please log any issues, technical or incompatibilities that you find.
