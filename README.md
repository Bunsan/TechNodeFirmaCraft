TechNodeFirmaCraft
==================

Configs, scripts, resourcepack and mod information for TechNodeFirmaCraft.

This pack is a Work in Progress. It is unknown how stable this pack is at this time. Mods may come and go unannounced. Expect me to break world for a while. Use the resource pack for some item renaming and textures for added items.

Know Issues.
- Piping into chests ignores item restriction based on size.
- No vanilla trees for tree breeding
- Some flowers for bees
- Food stuff
- Other dimensions are a not go (Nether is map destroying and the End does not exist)
- 

To Do's
- Make a proper To Do list
- List mods as required and optional
- HQM integration to fix roadblocks more than to guide progression.
- Mob tweaking (AI and stats)
- Lots more tweaks
- A few more mods
- Ore Gen is working, need to tweak balance
- So much balancing
- Resourcepack stuff


If you are crazy enough to try please log any issues that you find. Just try and see if I've even integrated that mods item/blocks into the pack by searching the modtweaker script.
